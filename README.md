# The-News-App (Currently working on this)
This is a Fullstack web application that can view news articles with the images and comments likes on them and publishers can add news and edit and maintain a publisher account as well and without logging any user can read the article but to like or comment they have to log in and this has separate authentication for the separate user levels and the Client side was created using the React and Redux, along with JWT and Server side was created using Nodejs and Express and Mongo db used as a DB and I hope to add the third part API for notification and social media loggings as well
